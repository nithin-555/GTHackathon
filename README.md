# GTHackathon
Automated Data Pipeline & Report Generation System
 Overview

This project is an end-to-end automated system that ingests data from multiple sources, processes and transforms it, generates AI-powered insights, and produces formatted PDF or PowerPoint reports — all without any manual intervention.

Features

Multi-Source Data Ingestion
Supports CSV files, SQL databases, and other structured data sources.

Automated Data Processing
Uses Pandas/Polars for fast and optimized data transformation.

AI-Powered Insights
Integrates GPT-4o / Gemini to generate intelligent summaries, insights, and commentary.

Automated Report Generation
Produces polished PDFs and PowerPoint (PPTX) files with charts and AI-generated narratives.

Zero Manual Intervention
Fully automated pipeline, from data ingestion → report export.
